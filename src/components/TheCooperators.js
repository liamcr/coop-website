                    <h3>The Co-operators</h3>
                    <em>Summer 2019</em>
                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>In this report I will identify what I took away from this past work term. 
                        I will recount how I took the last four months as an opportunity to enhance 
                        my technical skills, as well as improve my ability to effectively work in a 
                        group setting.</p>
                    <h4>About the Company</h4>
                    <p>Over the summer, I worked at the Co-operators in downtown Guelph. 
                        I worked with the automotive insurance team performing maintenance on 
                        PolicyCenter (A software used by agents to quote clients on their 
                        insurance policies). My job focussed on developing in an object-oriented 
                        programming language called Gosu. This language was developed by Guidewire 
                        (The company that developed the base version of PolicyCenter), and was 
                        heavily influenced by Java.</p>
                    <p>As a company, a lot of the cutting-edge development being done relies on 
                        the sheer amount of data the company has access to. For example, one of 
                        the major projects being developed is the ability to assess a building’s 
                        risk of flooding or water damage down to the accuracy of an individual 
                        building. This is something no other insurance company in Canada has 
                        done (All risk evaluations for water are typically done at a postal code 
                        level of accuracy). The Co-operators are able to do this due to the data 
                        available to them.</p>
                    <p>An interesting fact about the Co-operators is that the company is a 
                        co-operative rather than a corporation. This means that it is a business 
                        owned by the people using its services. Rather than make all business 
                        decisions based solely on potential profit and revenue, the wants and 
                        needs of the users also come into the equation due to the fact that the 
                        Co-operators Group is owned by them.</p>
                    <h4>Goals/Learning Objectives</h4>
                    <p>First and foremost, what were my learning goals? Did I achieve them?</p>
                    <h5>I would like to improve my oral communication skills by 
                        contributing/presenting something of significance to a meeting, which 
                        will allow me to further understand and be more engaged in the 
                        development of projects.</h5>
                    <p>I presented my projects and progress in daily scrum meetings, as well 
                        as gave a few demos to a handful of people, but I never formally 
                        presented any feature in a significant meeting, such as the monthly team 
                        meetings. This was a doable goal, but I simply did not make enough of an 
                        effort to make it happen. It is surely something I will try to do in my 
                        future terms.</p>
                    <h5>I would like to improve my problem-solving skills by learning how to 
                        efficiently understand and fix a complex issue on Jira.</h5>
                    <p>This one ended up being a relatively easy goal to achieve, and by the end 
                        of the term I could tackle most Jira issues from the ground up on 
                        my own.</p>
                    <h5>I would like to contribute a useful new feature to PolicyCenter 
                        (or any other software I may be helping in developing) from scratch.</h5>
                    <p>One of the new features I added to PolicyCenter was a page that allowed 
                        the user to search for drivers by their ID, and re-enrol them into the 
                        company’s En-Route service. This was used whenever an initial enrol request 
                        failed, and proved to be a very helpful addition to the software.</p>
                    <h5>I would like to improve my written communication skills by assisting in 
                        writing a professional document, such as documentation, or a testing plan 
                        document.</h5>
                    <p>Aside from commenting all of the code I wrote; I never did anything more 
                        in terms of documentation. It is still something I wish I had made the 
                        time to do, but with all of the other responsibilities of the job, it fell 
                        off of my radar a bit.</p>
                    <p>When coming up with my goals for the term, I tried to make sure they were 
                        related to my position. Resolving a complex issue on Jira and developing 
                        a new feature in PolicyCenter were very much related to my job 
                        responsibilities, as I was working with both Jira and PolicyCenter on a 
                        daily basis. Contributing something in a meeting, as well as writing 
                        documentation, are both tasks that were not necessary for an employee in 
                        my position, but are nonetheless very much related to my work.</p>
                    <p>In terms of technical skills, I wanted to improve on both my ability 
                        to use object-	oriented programming effectively, and my ability to 
                        write efficient SQL queries. These are both skills I have had experience 
                        with in the past, but I feel these are very important skills to know how 
                        to use effectively, and I made an effort to understand and learn new ways 
                        to write code and queries.</p>
                    <p>In terms of soft skills, I wanted to learn how to be a more effective 
                        communicator and team member. Teamwork is arguably the most important 
                        skill when it comes to succeeding in the workplace, so I believe the 
                        improvement I saw in myself over the last 4 months will be very crucial 
                        when it comes to performance in future positions.</p>
                    <p>The two specific technologies I wanted to work with were Jira and Git. 
                        Jira is a very effective and prevalent technology when it comes to 
                        managing tasks and issues in a team environment. I will no doubt be 
                        using this technology in the future, so I wanted to get a head start and 
                        become familiar with it early. Git is the most common version-control 
                        system out there, and will be used at most places I work in the future. 
                        It’s an important tool to know how to use in a team setting as well as in 
                        an individual setting, so it will be no doubt helpful to learn.</p>
                    <h4>Job Description</h4>
                    <p>I worked as a Junior Systems Developer on the PolicyCenter maintenance 
                        team. My job was to take user-submitted Jira issues, identify the root 
                        cause, and go through the formal process of fixing any defects within the 
                        code. Root-cause analysis was one of the more interesting parts of the job, 
                        as it was sort of like a puzzle to try and find the logic error in the 
                        large code base.</p>
                    <p>The work environment was very agile. It was very open-concept so that 
                        everyone could easily communicate with one another, and every afternoon 
                        at 1:15 we had our daily scrum meeting where each person updated the team 
                        on what they have been working on, what they are currently working on, 
                        and what they will be working on until the next meeting.</p>
                    <p>In order to succeed in this position, I needed teamwork skills, as well as 
                        skills in object-oriented programming and SQL. Teamwork was something I 
                        learned more about on the job than I had in school. I believe this is 
                        because I was working with experienced full-time employees that knew how 
                        to create an effective team environment. Object-oriented programming and 
                        SQL, however, were both skills that I learned more about in school, but 
                        working with them on a daily basis really helped me refine those skills 
                        even more. For example, a SQL join is a concept that I knew of from class, 
                        but I really needed to think hard about them in order to use them 
                        correctly. After using them every day, they have become very intuitive 
                        and easy to understand.</p>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>Ultimately, this work term was a great learning experience for me. 
                        It was the first time I had really worked with a team on a project for 
                        so long, and it helped me improve my soft skills immensely. I had the 
                        freedom to refine and fine-tune my technical skills where I felt necessary, 
                        and my superiors helped me to achieve all of the goals that I wanted to. I 
                        did not realize all of my learning outcomes for the term, and I definitely 
                        have room to improve, but at the end of the day, the first work term is all 
                        about understanding how to work in a team environment and identifying where 
                        I can improve. I learned a lot over the past 4 months, and I am looking 
                        forward to using this knowledge to further improve in my future 
                        work terms.</p>
