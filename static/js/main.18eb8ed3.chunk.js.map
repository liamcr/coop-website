I\r\n            worked with the automotive insurance team performing maintenance on\r\n            PolicyCenter (A software used by agents to quote clients on their\r\n            insurance policies). My job focussed on developing in an\r\n            object-oriented programming language called Gosu. This language was\r\n            developed by Guidewire (The company that developed the base version\r\n            of PolicyCenter), and was heavily influenced by Java.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            As a company, a lot of the cutting-edge development being done\r\n            relies on the sheer amount of data the company has access to. For\r\n            example, one of the major projects being developed is the ability to\r\n            assess a building’s risk of flooding or water damage down to the\r\n            accuracy of an individual building. This is something no other\r\n            insurance company in Canada has done (All risk evaluations for water\r\n            are typically done at a postal code level of accuracy). The\r\n            Co-operators are able to do this due to the data available to them.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            An interesting fact about the Co-operators is that the company is a\r\n            co-operative rather than a corporation. This means that it is a\r\n            business owned by the people using its services. Rather than make\r\n            all business decisions based solely on potential profit and revenue,\r\n            the wants and needs of the users also come into the equation due to\r\n            the fact that the Co-operators Group is owned by them.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"goalsLearningObjectives\",\r\n        title: \"Goals/Learning Objectives\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            First and foremost, what were my learning goals? Did I achieve them?\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            I would like to improve my oral communication skills by\r\n            contributing/presenting something of significance to a meeting,\r\n            which will allow me to further understand and be more engaged in the\r\n            development of projects.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            I presented my projects and progress in daily scrum meetings, as\r\n            well as gave a few demos to a handful of people, but I never\r\n            formally presented any feature in a significant meeting, such as the\r\n            monthly team meetings. This was a doable goal, but I simply did not\r\n            make enough of an effort to make it happen. It is surely something I\r\n            will try to do in my future terms.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            I would like to improve my problem-solving skills by learning how to\r\n            efficiently understand and fix a complex issue on Jira.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            This one ended up being a relatively easy goal to achieve, and by\r\n            the end of the term I could tackle most Jira issues from the ground\r\n            up on my own.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            I would like to contribute a useful new feature to PolicyCenter (or\r\n            any other software I may be helping in developing) from scratch.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            One of the new features I added to PolicyCenter was a page that\r\n            allowed the user to search for drivers by their ID, and re-enrol\r\n            them into the company’s En-Route service. This was used whenever an\r\n            initial enrol request failed, and proved to be a very helpful\r\n            addition to the software.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            I would like to improve my written communication skills by assisting\r\n            in writing a professional document, such as documentation, or a\r\n            testing plan document.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            Aside from commenting all of the code I wrote; I never did anything\r\n            more in terms of documentation. It is still something I wish I had\r\n            made the time to do, but with all of the other responsibilities of\r\n            the job, it fell off of my radar a bit.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            When coming up with my goals for the term, I tried to make sure they\r\n            were related to my position. Resolving a complex issue on Jira and\r\n            developing a new feature in PolicyCenter were very much related to\r\n            my job responsibilities, as I was working with both Jira and\r\n            PolicyCenter on a daily basis. Contributing something in a meeting,\r\n            as well as writing documentation, are both tasks that were not\r\n            necessary for an employee in my position, but are nonetheless very\r\n            much related to my work.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In terms of technical skills, I wanted to improve on both my ability\r\n            to use object-oriented programming effectively, and my ability to\r\n            write efficient SQL queries. These are both skills I have had\r\n            experience with in the past, but I feel these are very important\r\n            skills to know how to use effectively, and I made an effort to\r\n            understand and learn new ways to write code and queries.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In terms of soft skills, I wanted to learn how to be a more\r\n            effective communicator and team member. Teamwork is arguably the\r\n            most important skill when it comes to succeeding in the workplace,\r\n            so I believe the improvement I saw in myself over the last 4 months\r\n            will be very crucial when it comes to performance in future\r\n            positions.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            The two specific technologies I wanted to work with were Jira and\r\n            Git. Jira is a very effective and prevalent technology when it comes\r\n            to managing tasks and issues in a team environment. I will no doubt\r\n            be using this technology in the future, so I wanted to get a head\r\n            start and become familiar with it early. Git is the most common\r\n            version-control system out there, and will be used at most places I\r\n            work in the future. It’s an important tool to know how to use in a\r\n            team setting as well as in an individual setting, so it will be no\r\n            doubt helpful to learn.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"jobDescription\",\r\n        title: \"Job Description\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            I worked as a Junior Systems Developer on the PolicyCenter\r\n            maintenance team. My job was to take user-submitted Jira issues,\r\n            identify the root cause, and go through the formal process of fixing\r\n            any defects within the code. Root-cause analysis was one of the more\r\n            interesting parts of the job, as it was sort of like a puzzle to try\r\n            and find the logic error in the large code base.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            The work environment was very agile. It was very open-concept so\r\n            that everyone could easily communicate with one another, and every\r\n            afternoon at 1:15 we had our daily scrum meeting where each person\r\n            updated the team on what they have been working on, what they are\r\n            currently working on, and what they will be working on until the\r\n            next meeting.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In order to succeed in this position, I needed teamwork skills, as\r\n            well as skills in object-oriented programming and SQL. Teamwork was\r\n            something I learned more about on the job than I had in school. I\r\n            believe this is because I was working with experienced full-time\r\n            employees that knew how to create an effective team environment.\r\n            Object-oriented programming and SQL, however, were both skills that\r\n            I learned more about in school, but working with them on a daily\r\n            basis really helped me refine those skills even more. For example, a\r\n            SQL join is a concept that I knew of from class, but I really needed\r\n            to think hard about them in order to use them correctly. After using\r\n            them every day, they have become very intuitive and easy to\r\n            understand.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"conclusion\",\r\n        title: \"Conclusion\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            Ultimately, this work term was a great learning experience for me.\r\n            It was the first time I had really worked with a team on a project\r\n            for so long, and it helped me improve my soft skills immensely. I\r\n            had the freedom to refine and fine-tune my technical skills where I\r\n            felt necessary, and my superiors helped me to achieve all of the\r\n            goals that I wanted to. I did not realize all of my learning\r\n            outcomes for the term, and I definitely have room to improve, but at\r\n            the end of the day, the first work term is all about understanding\r\n            how to work in a team environment and identifying where I can\r\n            improve.

The WSIB (Workplace Safety and Insurance\r\n            Board) is Ontario’s governing worker’s compensation board. The lab\r\n            is interesting in that, rather than being heavily intertwined within\r\n            the WSIB, it acts as its own separate entity. This allows the lab to\r\n            experiment with different cutting-edge technologies without\r\n            interfering with the current workflows of the company as a whole. My\r\n            job focussed primarily on developing with React and JavaScript.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            One of the main purposes of the lab is to help improve the processes\r\n            within the WSIB. For example, the Board receives many complaints\r\n            regarding the process of how noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)\r\n            claims are handled. It can take upwards of one year for an employee\r\n            to acquire the hearing aid they need. As a result, the lab was\r\n            tasked with improving the NIHL workflow. Using technologies such as\r\n            React, Docker, and Kubernetes, the lab developed a website to guide\r\n            an injured worker through the process of setting up an NIHL claim,\r\n            including a calculator to determine what their claim is worth.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"goalsLearningObjectives\",\r\n        title: \"Goals/Learning Objectives\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            First and foremost, what were my learning goals? Did I achieve them?\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            By the end of my term, I want to have developed a complete mobile\r\n            application.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            I believe developing a complete mobile application was an ambitious\r\n            goal, as there will always be improvements I would want to add to\r\n            the app. However, I began development of an application from\r\n            scratch, and brought it to a place that I am content with. The\r\n            application included concepts such as machine learning, and\r\n            object-oriented programming in Swift.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            By the end of the term, I want to have implemented machine learning\r\n            concepts in some way.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            I was able to successfully implement a machine learning model into\r\n            my aforementioned mobile application. The idea for the model was to\r\n            take raw accelerometer data from a worker, and determine whether or\r\n            not the user is fatigued. The model was trained on data provided\r\n            from a study conducted by the University of Waterloo, and was fit\r\n            using a support vector machine.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            By the end of the term, I want to have contributed to a project that\r\n            actually gets used externally from the lab.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            Unfortunately, this is a goal I was not able to achieve.\r\n            Technically, I contributed to the lab’s website, which is used by\r\n            external users to the WSIB, but that is not what I had intended when\r\n            writing this goal. It’s true what they say, “The first 90 percent of\r\n            the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.\r\n            The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90\r\n            percent of the development time.” I was able to successfully create\r\n            an application with a solid core functionality, but it was the last\r\n            10 percent – the fine tuning, bug fixes, and design changes, that\r\n            prevented the application from moving past the concept stage.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <h5>\r\n            By the end of the term, I want to be comfortable sharing my opinions\r\n            at team meetings.\r\n          </h5>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            I did notice myself become more comfortable in a meeting setting by\r\n            the end of the term. Because of the exposure I had to frequent team\r\n            meetings and demos, I was able to become comfortable contributing\r\n            ideas to my team members.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            When coming up with my goals for the term, I tried to make sure they\r\n            were related to my position. Mobile development and machine learning\r\n            are two things that, although not required for my position, were\r\n            very applicable to the projects that I was working on. Feeling\r\n            comfortable in meetings was very much related to the\r\n            responsibilities included in my position, as I attended meetings on\r\n            a daily basis.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In terms of technical skills, I wanted to make an effort to take in\r\n            as many new technologies as I could. Mobile development with Swift,\r\n            machine learning, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes are all examples of\r\n            technologies and concepts that, although I had no prior experience\r\n            with them, I became familiar with. I also wanted to improve and\r\n            refine my skills with familiar technologies such as Jira and Git,\r\n            both of which I used on a daily basis.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In terms of soft skills, I wanted to learn how to be a more\r\n            effective communicator and team member. Teamwork is arguably the\r\n            most important skill when it comes to succeeding in the workplace,\r\n            so I believe the improvement I saw in myself over the last 4 months\r\n            will be very crucial when it comes to performance in future\r\n            positions.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            The one concept that I really wanted to get out of this position was\r\n            experience with machine learning. It seems to be the direction the\r\n            world is going in terms of advanced technology, and I wanted to make\r\n            sure I understood it, as well as apply it.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"jobDescription\",\r\n        title: \"Job Description\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            I worked as a Full-Stack Developer at the Innovation Lab. My job was\r\n            to not only help in developing the lab’s website, but also do\r\n            research and development on technologies that could improve the\r\n            WSIB’s workflows.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            The project I primarily worked on throughout the term was a fatigue\r\n            analysis application. A significant number of worker’s compensation\r\n            claims come from masonry workers who became injured on the job. The\r\n            injuries are often caused because the worker had to work through\r\n            fatigue when they should have been taking a break. The fatigue\r\n            analysis application uses motion sensors attached to the user’s body\r\n            to track their movements, and uses a machine learning model to\r\n            determine whether or not the worker is fatigued. When it is\r\n            determined that the user is fatigued, a push notification would be\r\n            sent to the worker encouraging them to take a break. This would, in\r\n            theory, reduce the number of fatigue-induced masonry injuries.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            The work environment was very agile. We had eight co-op students\r\n            gathered around a table together so that in the event that some\r\n            requirements change, or a different problem arose, we could easily\r\n            notify the relevant co-workers on the other teams. Every morning at\r\n            9:30 we had our daily stand-up meeting where each person updated the\r\n            team as to what they have been working on, what they are currently\r\n            working on, and what they will be working on until the next meeting.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            In order to succeed in this position, I needed technical programming\r\n            skills, as well as skills in time-management, organization, and\r\n            teamwork. Teamwork was something I learned more about on the job\r\n            than I had in school. I believe this is because I had the\r\n            opportunity to work on projects larger than a typical individual\r\n            assignment. Time-management and organization skills were very\r\n            important due to the entrepreneurial setting the workplace provided.\r\n            I was the project manager for the fatigue analysis application, and\r\n            without proper time management and organization skills, deadlines\r\n            would not be met, and the project ultimately would not have been\r\n            worked on as efficiently.\r\n          </p>,\r\n          <p>\r\n            My technical programming skills, however, were skills that I learned\r\n            more about in school, but working with them on a daily basis helped\r\n            me refine those skills further. For example, an HTTP request is a\r\n            concept I first learned about in the classroom, but implementing\r\n            this in a work environment made the concept easier and more\r\n            intuitive to understand.\r\n          </p>\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"conclusion\",\r\n        title: \"Conclusion\",\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n          <p>\r\n            Ultimately, this work term was a great learning experience for me.\r\n            It was the first time I had really worked so closely with other\r\n            teams on a large project, and it helped me improve my soft skills\r\n            immensely. I had the freedom to refine and fine-tune my technical\r\n            skills where I felt necessary, and my superiors helped me to achieve\r\n            all of the goals that I set for myself. I did not realize all of my\r\n            learning outcomes for the term, and I definitely have room to\r\n            improve, but at the end of the day I was able to apply everything I\r\n            initially wanted to, including different technical skills, and soft\r\n            skills such as teamwork and project management.
