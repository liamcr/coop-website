This is something no other insurance company in Canada has done (All risk evaluations for water are typically done at a postal code level of accuracy). The Co-operators are able to do this due to the data available to them."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"An interesting fact about the Co-operators is that the company is a co-operative rather than a corporation.

Object-oriented programming and SQL, however, were both skills that I learned more about in school, but working with them on a daily basis really helped me refine those skills even more.

I did not realize all of my learning outcomes for the term, and I definitely have room to improve, but at the end of the day, the first work term is all about understanding how to work in a team environment and identifying where I can improve.
